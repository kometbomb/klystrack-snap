# klystrack-snap
Creates a snap for [klystrack](https://github.com/kometbomb/klystrack). Includes desktop-qt5 so the snap will be huge (but, hey, it works!).

The build process will download both klystrack and [klystron](https://github.com/kometbomb/klystron), build klystrack and snap the whole thing. It will use the code for the latest "stable" klystrack.
